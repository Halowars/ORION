Let me ask some diagnostic questions: How large are these videos typically? And are you recording them in the app or uploading from your camera roll?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Usually 30-60 second videos, recording them in the app. Maybe 20-50MB each?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "That size should upload fine. When they fail, do you get any error message, or does it just stop?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "It shows a progress bar that gets to like 60-70% then says 'Upload failed - please try again'"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "That specific failure pattern usually indicates a session timeout issue. The upload is taking longer than our server allows for one session. This can happen if: 1) Your internet speed is inconsistent, 2) You're uploading in very high resolution, or 3) There's a bug in our upload handler. Let me check your app settings - what video quality setting are you using? Settings > Video > Recording Quality."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "It's set to '4K - Highest Quality'"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's the issue! 4K videos create much larger files than necessary for most use cases, and they're timing out during upload. Change that setting to '1080p - High Quality.' Your videos will still look great, but the file sizes will be 1/4 as large and upload much faster. This should completely eliminate the timeout failures."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Will that affect videos I already recorded?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, only future recordings. For the 4K videos you already have that won't upload, you have two options: 1) I can enable 'extended upload time' on your account which gives you 10 minutes instead of 3 minutes per upload, or 2) You can re-record them in 1080p. Which would you prefer?"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Can you enable the extended time? I don't want to re-record."},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Done. I've enabled extended upload timeout for your account. Try uploading one of those failed 4K videos now. It should complete successfully. And going forward, recording in 1080p will prevent any issues."}
